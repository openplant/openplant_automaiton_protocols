<h1>Exporting DNA sequence files from Benchling</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Benchling (https://www.benchling.com/) is a cloud-based platform for biotechnology research and development, combining an integrated molecular biology design tool, LIMS system, and in-built electronic lab notebook all together. 
In this tutorial, we will explore how to import and export DNA sequences from Benchling into different file formats, such as .fasta / .gb / .dna / other for use with others DNA editor softwares (e.g. SnapGene, EGF, SBOL Seq Improver, SynBICT, etc.)</p>
<p></p>

<h3>How to import DNA sequences in Benchling:</h3>
<p>Benchling has a tutorial on how to import DNA sequences: <a href="https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684298175245-Importing-DNA-sequences">Importing DNA sequences – Benchling</a>. This is the first step to get your sequences into the platform. </p>
<p></p>
<p>To export DNA sequences in different formats, you can follow this tutorial: <a href="https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684263522189-Export-DNA-Sequences-gb-fasta-csv-svg-rdf-zip-">Export DNA Sequences (.gb, .fasta, .csv, .svg, .rdf, .zip) – Benchling</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>A working example</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We will use sequences available in Addgene as an example. Follow the link and download the sequence in gbk format (Genebank). </p>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.addgene.org/136695/sequences/">Addgene: pCk1 Sequences</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.addgene.org/50268/">Addgene: pICH51277</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.addgene.org/50325/">Addgene: pICSL80004</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.addgene.org/50337/">Addgene: pICH41414</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once downloaded, go to Benchgling and import these sequences by following these steps: <a href="https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684298175245-Importing-DNA-sequences">Importing DNA sequences – Benchling</a>. Then, use Benchling again to export these sequences into the desired extension format: <a href="https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9684263522189-Export-DNA-Sequences-gb-fasta-csv-svg-rdf-zip-">Export DNA Sequences (.gb, .fasta, .csv, .svg, .rdf, .zip) – Benchling</a></p>
