<h1>Protocols</h1>

<p>
    Welcome to the OpenPlant Automation Protocols. Here you will find a collection of three types of protocols, ranging three ways of interacting with your OT2 robot.
</p>

<h3>Protocol Designer protocols</h3>

<p>Protocols made with <a href="https://designer.opentrons.com/">Opentrons' protocol designer</a> can be visualized and edited within 
    the designer. This is the most user-friendly way to interact with the protocols.
</p>

<h3>Python protocols</h3>

<p>OT python protocols are made to give nuanced control of robot commands to the user, be easily customisable, and integrate the 
    benefits of working with the python environment while still enabling the potocols to be run by researchers without programming 
    experience. See the <a href="https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/">Opentrons python API documentation</a> for reference on the code itself.
</p>

<h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>

<p>These protocols control the robot in a more granular, real-time (and incidentally hands-on) manner. While this allows for quick 
    customization and prototyping, it also requires some understanding of python and Jupyter Notebooks to operate. Refer to 
    <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Tutorials/Jupyter Notebooks">our tutorial</a> for instructions 
    on how to set up Jupyter Notebook-control on the robot.
