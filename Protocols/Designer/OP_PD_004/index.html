<h1>Transformation Spreading to 6 Well Plates</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This set of protocols transfers samples from a 96 well plate to 6-well plates containing solid media.</p>
<p>There are four separate protocols which carry out the transfer of 24 samples to four 6-well plates, resulting in 96 samples being transferred to sixteen 6-well plates.</p>

<h2>Labware and Liquids</h2>
<img src="OP_PD_004-deckmap.png", style="width: 80%">
<ul>
    <li>Left mount: An 8-channel p300 pipette (GEN2)</li>
    <li>Slot 1, 4, 7 and 10: 6-well culture plates containing solid media</li>
    <li>Slot 3: 300Âµl Tip Rack</li>
    <li>Slot 6: 96 Well PCR Plate containing the samples</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Select the correct protocol for the set of samples requiring transfer.</li>
    <li>Set up the deck as described above and as in the initial protocol pause step.</li>
    <li>Run the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and best practices</h2>
<p>Carry out a test run of the protocol using the labware and water to ensure that the positioning of labware and tips is suitable. Re-calibration of the deck or labware may be required.</p>
<p>Label the 6-well plates clearly to ensure the traceability of the samples from the PCR plate to the 6-well plates.</p>
<p>Following completion of the protocol(s) gently roll the plates to ensure that the sample is spread across the solid media.</p>
