<h1>Plating of cells from 96-well plates</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This protocol carries out plating of cells in a 96-well plate to multiple 6-well plates with solid culture media</p>
<p>For help with how to run Jupyter Notebook protocols, refer to <a href="https://openplant.github.io/openplant_automation_protocols/Tutorials/Jupyter%20Notebooks/">our tutorial</a></p>

<h2>Labware and Liquids</h2>
<img src="OP_JN_005-deckmap.png", style="width: 80%">
<ul>
    <li>Right mount: A p300 pipette</li>
    <li>Slot 10: A 96-well PCR plate with cells</li>
    <li>Slots 1 to 9: 6-well plates up to the necessary number</li>
    <li>Slot 11: Tiprack for the pipette</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Label the required number of plates appropriately. Simulate the protocol first to see how the plating sequence will happen (A1 through H1, then A2 through H2, etc)</li>
    <li>Set up the deck as described above</li>
    <li>Run the cells one by one, paying attention to prompts and instructions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and best practices</h2>
<p>Depending on the required number of samples, this protocol requires you to change the plates on the deck after the first 9 are done</p>
<p>To avoid contamination from the tips going to the trash bin, it's advisable to start with all the plates covered and remove their lids as the protocol progresses</p>
<p>Move plates to a nutator at slow rotation speed after this protocol is done, so that the cells can be spreaded properly</p>
