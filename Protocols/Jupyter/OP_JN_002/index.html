<h1>DNA extraction of 96-well cultures with magnetic beads</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This protocol carries out DNA extraction of bacterial cultures in a 96-deepwell plate with the magnetic module</p>
<p>For help with how to run Jupyter Notebook protocols, refer to <a href="#">our tutorial</a></p>

<h2>Labware and Liquids</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Right mount: An 8-channel p300 pipette</li>
    <li>Slot 1: 12-well reservoir with buffers
        <ul>
        <li>Well 1: Lysis buffer</li>
        <li>Well 2: Neutralization buffer</li>
        <li>Well 3: Wash buffer</li>
        <li>Well 4: Ethanol</li>
        <li>Well 5: Elution Buffer</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Slot 4: 96-deepwell plate (square wells) with ressuspended bacterial cell pellets</li>
    <li>Slot 7: Magnetic module with 96-deepwell plate (square wells) with 100uL of magnetic beads</li>
    <li>Slot 9: Output plate in 96-well format</li>
    <li>Slot 10: 1-well reservoir for buffer waste</li>
    <li>Slots 2, 3: Tipracks for p300</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Start by centrifuging the culture plate, removing the supernatant and ressuspending the pellets in ressuspension buffer</li>
    <li>Set up the deck as described above</li>
    <li>Run the cells one by one, paying attention to prompts and instructions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tips and best practices</h2>
<p>This is a protocol with many manual steps. You will have to monitor and work along the robot throughout the whole protocol</p>
