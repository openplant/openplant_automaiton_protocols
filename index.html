                <p>The Open Bioeconomy Lab and the Earlham Institute are collaborating to validate and make available a library of protocols
                    and automation scripts for the Opentrons OT2 platform. We hope this collection of protocols can inspire more researchers to 
                    adapt their workflows for automation, enabling a higher throughput and efficiency in general molecular biology work.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
             
                <p>Follow <a href="https://support.opentrons.com/s/ot2-get-started">Opentrons' official guidance</a> on setting up the OT2 robot
                    and its software. Here we provide protocols to be run on the OT-2 robot with the current software version (v6.2.1 as of this 
                    writing) with GEN2 pipettes and modules. All custom labware needed is specified in 'Custom Labware' and will be indicared on
                    specific protocol documents.
                </p>

                <h3>Protocol Designer protocols</h3>

                <p>Protocols made with <a href="https://designer.opentrons.com/">Opentrons' protocol designer</a> can be visualized and edited within 
                    the designer. This is the most user-friendly way to interact with the protocols.
                </p>

                <h3>Python protocols</h3>

                <p>OT python protocols are made to give nuanced control of robot commands to the user, be easily customisable, and integrate the 
                    benefits of working with the python environment while still enabling the potocols to be run by researchers without programming 
                    experience. See the <a href="https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/">Opentrons python API documentation</a> for reference on the code itself.
                </p>

                <h3>Jupyter Notebooks</h3>

                <p>These protocols control the robot in a more granular, real-time (and incidentally hands-on) manner. While this allows for quick 
                    customization and prototyping, it also requires some understanding of python and Jupyter Notebooks to operate. Refer to 
                    <a href="https://support.opentrons.com/s/article/Running-the-robot-using-Jupyter-Notebook">this article</a> for instructions 
                    on how to set up Jupyter Notebook-control on the robot.
